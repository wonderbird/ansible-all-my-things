# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Kiro IDE installation to the existing Ansible playbooks for Linux hosts. Kiro should be installed on physical Linux machines (AWS EC2, Hetzner Cloud) but excluded from virtualized test environments (Vagrant Docker, Vagrant Tart) where it's not needed or practical to run a full IDE.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Kiro IDE automatically installed on my Linux development machines, so that I have a consistent development environment across all my physical hosts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the configure-linux.yml playbook runs THEN the system SHALL install the latest version of Kiro IDE
2. WHEN the target host is a Vagrant Docker instance THEN the system SHALL skip Kiro installation
3. WHEN the target host is a Vagrant Tart instance THEN the system SHALL skip Kiro installation
4. WHEN the target host is an AWS EC2 Linux instance THEN the system SHALL install Kiro IDE
5. WHEN the target host is a Hetzner Cloud Linux instance THEN the system SHALL install Kiro IDE

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro installed using the official installation method, so that I get the latest stable version with proper updates and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing Kiro THEN the system SHALL use the official Kiro installation script or package manager
2. WHEN Kiro is already installed THEN the system SHALL update it to the latest version
3. WHEN the installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and continue with other tasks
4. WHEN Kiro is installed THEN the system SHALL verify the installation was successful

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Kiro installation to be idempotent, so that running the playbook multiple times doesn't cause issues or unnecessary downloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro is already installed at the latest version THEN the system SHALL skip the installation step
2. WHEN the playbook runs multiple times THEN the system SHALL not re-download Kiro unnecessarily
3. WHEN checking for existing installations THEN the system SHALL properly detect the current Kiro version

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro available for all desktop users on the system, so that any user can access the IDE without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro is installed THEN the system SHALL make it available system-wide
2. WHEN a desktop user logs in THEN they SHALL be able to launch Kiro from their application menu
3. WHEN Kiro is installed THEN it SHALL have proper desktop integration (icons, file associations)
