# Progress: Ansible All My Things

## Current Status

### AppArmor Implementation Spike ðŸŸ¡ READY TO START
**Status**: AppArmor learning completed, scrum stories defined, ready for implementation
**Goal**: Validate kernel-level command restrictions via manual configuration on rivendell
**Timeline**: 3 scrum stories (0.5 + 1-2 + 1 days) for complete implementation
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - required for safe AI agent operation on target systems

## What Works

### Cross-Provider Infrastructure âœ… OPERATIONAL
- **Hetzner Cloud Linux**: `hobbiton` - Complete development environment (~$4/month)
- **AWS Linux**: `rivendell` - On-demand development server (~$8-10/month)
- **AWS Windows**: `moria` - Windows application server with Claude Desktop access (~$60/month on-demand)

### Core System Features âœ… OPERATIONAL
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete automation of environment lifecycle across providers
- **Security by Design**: Ansible Vault encryption, SSH key management working cross-provider
- **Unified Management**: Single automation framework managing diverse infrastructure
- **Cross-Provider Documentation**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **Target System Architecture**: AI agents operate on provisioned systems under desktop_users accounts
- **AppArmor Expertise**: âœ… Stand-Alone Profiling mastered with hands-on wget security profile creation

## What's Next

### AppArmor Implementation ðŸŸ¡ SCRUM STORIES READY
- **Goal**: Deploy kernel-level command restrictions to Linux target systems via AppArmor
- **Target Systems**: `hobbiton`, `rivendell` under `desktop_users` accounts (`galadriel`, `legolas`)
- **Implementation Strategy**: âœ… REFINED
  - **Comprehensive Profile**: Single profile blocking all infrastructure commands (`deny /usr/bin/ansible* x,` etc.)
  - **Profile Path**: `/etc/apparmor.d/ai-agent-block` via ansible templates
  - **User Targeting**: `/etc/security/pam_apparmor.conf` configuration for desktop_users
  - **Ansible Integration**: Extend `playbooks/setup-users.yml` workflow
  - **Verification**: `aa-status` command through ansible tasks
  - **Fallback**: Claude CLI Native via `~/.claude/settings.json` deployment
  - **Security Constraint**: AI agents excluded from sudoers group (no `sudo` access)

**Scrum Stories**:
1. **Fresh rivendell Provisioning** (0.5 day) - Deploy clean target system
2. **Manual AppArmor Spike** (1-2 days) - Create and validate comprehensive profile
3. **Ansible Automation** (1 day) - Deploy via ansible with remote verification

- **Acceptance Tests**: `bash -c "ansible --version"` fails, `bash -c "ls -la"` succeeds
- **Success Criteria**: Kernel-level blocking across Claude tool calls, remote verification, reboot persistence

### Documentation Streamlining âœ… COMPLETED
- **Memory Bank Restructured**: Removed discovery narrative and "broken state" language from all files
- **Implementation Approaches Consolidated**: From 8 scattered options to 6 clear approaches with 5 viable options
- **Forward-Looking Documentation**: Rewritten as if target system deployment was always the known approach
- **fapolicyd Research**: Comprehensive analysis completed, documented but assessed as unsuitable for cross-platform requirements
- **AppArmor Research**: Ubuntu/Debian equivalent identified with kernel-level security and user-specific targeting capabilities

## Technical Foundation

### Infrastructure Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
- **Multi-Provider**: Proven abstraction patterns across AWS and Hetzner Cloud
- **Cross-Platform**: Both Linux and Windows implementations working
- **Cost Optimization**: Provider choice optimized for specific usage patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing framework with proper variable management

### Current Implementation Status
- **Cross-Provider Infrastructure**: Three production-ready implementations successfully deployed âœ…
- **Enhanced Inventory System**: Advanced inventory structure with provider-specific targeting âœ…
- **Idiomatic Ansible Configuration**: Complete transition to best practices âœ…
- **Target System Deployment**: Ready for command restriction implementation âœ…

## Next Immediate Actions

**Scrum Sprint Ready**:

**Story 1: Fresh rivendell Provisioning** (0.5 day)
- Execute `ansible-playbook provision-aws-linux.yml --vault-password-file ansible-vault-password.txt`
- Verify SSH access: `ssh galadriel@$RIVENDELL_IP`
- Confirm clean Ubuntu/Debian system ready for AppArmor installation

**Story 2: Manual AppArmor Spike** (1-2 days)
- Install AppArmor: `apt install apparmor-utils`
- Create comprehensive profile: `/etc/apparmor.d/ai-agent-block` with all infrastructure command denials
- Configure user targeting: `/etc/security/pam_apparmor.conf` for galadriel/legolas accounts
- Execute acceptance tests: Validate `bash -c "ansible --version"` fails, `bash -c "ls -la"` succeeds
- Document spike results for ansible automation decision

**Story 3: Ansible Automation** (1 day)
- Create AppArmor deployment tasks in `playbooks/setup-users.yml`
- Add remote verification via `aa-status` command through ansible
- Test idempotent deployment across multiple runs

## Recent Accomplishments

**Architecture Decision Record Created**: âœ… [ADR-001: Command Restriction Mechanism](../docs/architecture-decisions/001-command-restrictions.md) documenting complete decision rationale

**Decision Analysis Completed**: 
- **AppArmor Learning Completed**: âœ… Stand-Alone Profiling mastered with hands-on wget security profile creation
- **Profile Creation Strategy**: âœ… Comprehensive single profile approach identified as optimal for multiple command blocking
- **Sub-shell Validation**: âœ… Confirmed AppArmor works across Claude Code's independent bash sessions
- **Six Implementation Approaches Evaluated**: âœ… Comprehensive analysis with decision matrix and scoring rationale
- **AppArmor Selection**: âœ… Kernel-level enforcement approach selected (1.2 average score, superior effectiveness)
- **Fallback Strategy**: âœ… Claude CLI Native identified as viable alternative if AppArmor fails

**Implementation Planning Ready**:
- **Implementation Specifications**: âœ… Complete technical specifications moved to memory bank
- **Timeline Defined**: âœ… Two-phase implementation (spike + automation) ready for execution
- **Ansible Integration**: âœ… `playbooks/setup-users.yml` extension approach defined
- **Acceptance Criteria**: âœ… Clear success metrics and testing approach established

**Current Status**: The project has achieved its primary infrastructure objectives and comprehensive solution research. **Command restriction system implementation** is ready to begin with manual AppArmor spike on `rivendell` target system.
