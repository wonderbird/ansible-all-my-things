# Progress: Ansible All My Things

## Current Status

### AppArmor Implementation Spike ðŸ”´ URGENT
**Status**: AppArmor selected, ready for implementation spike
**Goal**: Validate kernel-level command restrictions via manual configuration on rivendell
**Timeline**: 2-3 days maximum for spike and implementation
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - required for safe AI agent operation on target systems

## What Works

### Cross-Provider Infrastructure âœ… OPERATIONAL
- **Hetzner Cloud Linux**: `hobbiton` - Complete development environment (~$4/month)
- **AWS Linux**: `rivendell` - On-demand development server (~$8-10/month)
- **AWS Windows**: `moria` - Windows application server with Claude Desktop access (~$60/month on-demand)

### Core System Features âœ… OPERATIONAL
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete automation of environment lifecycle across providers
- **Security by Design**: Ansible Vault encryption, SSH key management working cross-provider
- **Unified Management**: Single automation framework managing diverse infrastructure
- **Cross-Provider Documentation**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **Target System Architecture**: AI agents operate on provisioned systems under desktop_users accounts

## What's Next

### AppArmor Implementation ðŸ”´ IMPLEMENTATION READY
- **Goal**: Deploy kernel-level command restrictions to Linux target systems via AppArmor
- **Target Systems**: `hobbiton`, `rivendell` under `desktop_users` accounts (`galadriel`, `legolas`)
- **Implementation Specifications**: âœ… DEFINED
  - **Profile Path**: `/etc/apparmor.d/ai-agent-block` via ansible templates
  - **User Targeting**: `/etc/security/pam_apparmor.conf` configuration for desktop_users
  - **Ansible Integration**: Extend `playbooks/setup-users.yml` workflow
  - **Verification**: `aa-status` command through ansible tasks
  - **Fallback**: Claude CLI Native via `~/.claude/settings.json` deployment
  - **Security Constraint**: AI agents excluded from sudoers group (no `sudo` access)
- **Current Phase**: Manual configuration spike on fresh rivendell instance
- **Acceptance Tests**: `bash -c "ansible --version"` fails, `bash -c "ls -la"` succeeds
- **Success Criteria**: Kernel-level blocking across Claude tool calls, remote verification, reboot persistence

### Documentation Streamlining âœ… COMPLETED
- **Memory Bank Restructured**: Removed discovery narrative and "broken state" language from all files
- **Implementation Approaches Consolidated**: From 8 scattered options to 6 clear approaches with 5 viable options
- **Forward-Looking Documentation**: Rewritten as if target system deployment was always the known approach
- **fapolicyd Research**: Comprehensive analysis completed, documented but assessed as unsuitable for cross-platform requirements
- **AppArmor Research**: Ubuntu/Debian equivalent identified with kernel-level security and user-specific targeting capabilities

## Technical Foundation

### Infrastructure Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
- **Multi-Provider**: Proven abstraction patterns across AWS and Hetzner Cloud
- **Cross-Platform**: Both Linux and Windows implementations working
- **Cost Optimization**: Provider choice optimized for specific usage patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing framework with proper variable management

### Current Implementation Status
- **Cross-Provider Infrastructure**: Three production-ready implementations successfully deployed âœ…
- **Enhanced Inventory System**: Advanced inventory structure with provider-specific targeting âœ…
- **Idiomatic Ansible Configuration**: Complete transition to best practices âœ…
- **Target System Deployment**: Ready for command restriction implementation âœ…

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Provision Fresh rivendell**: Deploy clean AWS Linux instance for AppArmor spike testing
2. **AppArmor Manual Configuration**: Install AppArmor, create profile at `/etc/apparmor.d/ai-agent-block`, configure pam_apparmor
3. **Validation Testing**: Execute acceptance tests (`bash -c "ansible --version"` fails, `bash -c "ls -la"` succeeds)
4. **Decision Point**: Proceed with AppArmor ansible automation or fallback to Claude CLI Native approach
5. **Ansible Automation**: Create AppArmor deployment tasks in `playbooks/setup-users.yml` with remote verification

## Recent Accomplishments

- **Decision Analysis Completed**: âœ… Comprehensive evaluation of six implementation approaches
- **AppArmor Selection**: âœ… Kernel-level enforcement approach selected based on effectiveness priority
- **Implementation Strategy**: âœ… Spike-first validation approach defined for rivendell
- **Collaborative Decision Rationale**: âœ… Scoring matrix and decision logic documented for future reference
- **Fallback Strategy**: âœ… Claude CLI Native identified as viable alternative

The project has achieved its primary infrastructure objectives, completed comprehensive solution research, and is ready for command restriction system implementation on target systems.
