The `kiro` branch contains both the Kiro IDE installation logic and several unrelated project enhancements. The goal is to separate these concerns. This memory bank tracks the work to identify the general enhancements, plan their extraction, and port them to the `main` branch, leaving the `kiro` branch focused solely on its primary feature.
