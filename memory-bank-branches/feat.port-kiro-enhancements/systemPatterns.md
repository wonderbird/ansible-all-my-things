# System Patterns

Development follows a feature-branching workflow. Features and enhancements are developed in isolated branches. Once complete, they are merged into the `main` branch. This increment addresses the need to extract general improvements from a long-running feature branch (`kiro`) that should not be part of the final feature merge.
