# Product Context

To maintain project health and velocity, it is crucial that general improvements developed in feature branches are regularly integrated back into the `main` branch. This prevents feature branches from diverging significantly, reduces the complexity of future merges, and ensures all developers benefit from shared enhancements.

This work increment is focused on identifying and porting valuable, non-Kiro-specific enhancements from the `kiro` feature branch into `main`.
