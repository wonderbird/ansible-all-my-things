# Product Context

The primary goal is to enable developers to quickly spin up identical, fully-featured development environments. This reduces setup time and eliminates inconsistencies ("it works on my machine" problems). By automating the entire lifecycle of these environments, we ensure reproducibility and maintainability.

This specific increment focuses on integrating the Kiro IDE, a specialized development environment, into our standard Ubuntu Linux VMs to provide developers with a consistent and powerful toolset.
