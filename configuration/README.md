# Configuration for new virtual machines

This folder contains the default configuration by user in the folder
`./home`.

The [../backup.yml](../backup.yml) playbook will copy backup files to the
home directory for the corresponding user.

Note that the backup files are excluded from git in
[../.gitignore](../.gitignore).
