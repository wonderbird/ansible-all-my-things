# Only the user can run ansible commands

I run on a system, which cannot connect to the cloud providers and does not provide virtualization.

Whenenver I want to run ansible, vagrant, docker, aws, hcloud, etc., I ask the user for executing the command. Then I wait for their response before I draw conclusions or ask for running the next command.
