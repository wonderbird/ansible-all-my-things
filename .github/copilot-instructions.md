Ask clarifying questions if my instructions are unclear.

Repeat my question briefly before responding.

After completing code changes, commit to git with a conventional message: headline stating new capability (not action taken) + brief description under 50 words (bullet points allowed for readability). Example: use 'feat: show hello message on startup' not 'feat: implement printing hello on startup'.

Make your initial commit on the main branch only. After that, create feature branches following the pattern: feat/brief-description, fix/brief-description, or docs/brief-description (e.g., feat/add-hello-message).
