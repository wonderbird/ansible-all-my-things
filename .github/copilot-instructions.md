Ask clarifying questions if my instructions are unclear.

Repeat my question briefly before responding.

After completing code changes, commit to git with a conventional message: headline stating new capability (not action taken) + brief description under 50 words (bullet points allowed for readability). Example: use 'feat: show hello message on startup' not 'feat: implement printing hello on startup'.
