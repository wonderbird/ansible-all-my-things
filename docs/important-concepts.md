## SSH Key Compatibility

Different cloud providers and operating systems have varying SSH key type support:

### AWS EC2 Key Requirements

- **Linux AMIs**: Support all key types (RSA, ECDSA, ED25519)
- **Windows AMIs**: Only support RSA (minimum 2048-bit) and ECDSA keys
- **Important**: ED25519 keys are **not supported** for Windows AMIs

### Key Type Recommendations

- **For mixed environments**: Use RSA 2048-bit or higher for maximum compatibility
- **For Linux-only**: ED25519 keys are recommended for security and performance
- **For Windows Server**: Must use RSA or ECDSA keys

## Secrets are encrypted with Ansible Vault

The playbooks create user accounts and register SSH keys for passwordless login.

The required secrets are expected in `/inventories/group_vars/all/vault.yml`. This file shall be encrypted with ansible vault.

The ansible vault password is expected in `/ansible-vault-password.txt`. This way, the Vagrant provisioners in the [/test](../test/) folders can access it.

Both files are excluded from git via [/.gitignore](../.gitignore), so that secrets are not accidentally committed to the repository.

Execute the following commands in the repository root to set up the secrets:

```shell
# Create a new ansible vault password file
echo -n "New ansible vault password: " \
  && read -s ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD \
  && echo "$ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD" > ./ansible-vault-password.txt

# Create a new vault.yml file from the template
cp -v ./inventories/group_vars/all/vault-template.yml ./inventories/group_vars/all/vault.yml \
&& ansible-vault encrypt --vault-password-file ./ansible-vault-password.txt ./inventories/group_vars/all/vault.yml

# Replace the placeholders with your secrets
ansible-vault edit --vault-password-file ./ansible-vault-password.txt ./inventories/group_vars/all/vault.yml
```

## Admin user on fresh system differs per provider

Different providers set up machines with different administrator users. Check the provider and system specific group variables in the [/inventories/group_vars/](../inventories/group_vars/) directory. For example for a Linux instance in Hetzner Cloud: [/inventories/group_vars/hcloud_linux/vars.yml](../inventories/group_vars/hcloud_linux/vars.yml).

The inventory files for each provider and platform must specify the variable `admin_user_on_fresh_system`. It contains the name of the admin user to be used by ansible for the initial setup of the system.

## Same ansible user is set up for each provider

The `root` user shall only be used for a very short time. Thus, the [/playbooks/setup-users.yml](../playbooks/setup-users.yml) playbook is run as early as possible to create a new user with sudo privileges.

This `my_ansible_user` is configured in [/inventories/group_vars/all/vars.yml](../inventories/group_vars/all/vars.yml).

## Desktop user accounts are used to log in

[/inventories/group_vars/all/vars.yml](../inventories/group_vars/all/vars.yml) defines user names and passwords for the `desktop_users`. These accounts are intended for logging into the (desktop) environment.

The corresponding template file shows the structure of the secrets file: [/inventories/group_vars/all/vault-template.yml](../inventories/group_vars/all/vault-template.yml).
