# Next Steps: Documentation Updates Required

## Overview

This document contains an analysis of the differences between the memory bank (current working state) and the docs folder (user documentation). The analysis identifies critical gaps where important implementation details and architectural improvements are not reflected in the user documentation.

## Current Project Status

### Production-Ready Implementations âœ… COMPLETED
- **Hetzner Cloud Linux** (hobbiton): Complete desktop environment (~$4/month)
- **AWS Linux** (rivendell): On-demand development server (~$8-10/month) 
- **AWS Windows** (moria): Windows Server 2025 for Claude Desktop access (~$60/month)
- **Enhanced Inventory System**: Unified visibility with provider-specific targeting

## Critical Documentation Gaps

### 1. Enhanced Inventory System Architecture (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State in Memory Bank**: âœ… COMPLETED & IMPROVED
- Enhanced unified inventory system with dual keyed_groups
- Cross-provider groups (@linux, @windows) and provider-specific groups (@aws_ec2_linux, @hcloud_linux)
- Improved tag semantics: `platform: "linux"` instead of `ansible_group: "linux"`
- Four-tier variable precedence: all â†’ platform â†’ provider â†’ provider_platform
- Requirements.txt and requirements.yml for streamlined dependency management

**Documentation Status**: MISSING
- Current docs don't document the enhanced inventory system
- Missing group structure documentation
- No mention of improved tag semantics or variable precedence

**Required Updates**:
- Create comprehensive inventory system documentation
- Document new group structure and targeting capabilities
- Update command examples to reflect enhanced inventory patterns

### 2. Windows Server Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State in Memory Bank**: âœ… PRODUCTION-READY
- Complete Windows Server 2025 implementation on AWS

### 4. Streamlined Dependency Management (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State in Memory Bank**: âœ… STREAMLINED
- `requirements.txt` with specific versions and multi-provider support
- `requirements.yml` with Ansible collections
- Automated installation: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt && ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`

**Documentation Status**: MANUAL APPROACH
- Still references manual ansible-galaxy commands
- No mention of streamlined requirements files
- Missing automated dependency installation instructions

**Required Updates**:
- Update dependency installation instructions
- Document requirements files approach
- Simplify setup procedures

### 5. Command Structure Evolution (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current State in Memory Bank**: âœ… EVOLVED STRUCTURE
- Specific playbooks: `provision-aws-windows.yml`, `provision-aws-linux.yml`
- Unified cleanup: `destroy-aws.yml` (handles both Linux and Windows)
- Enhanced inventory targeting capabilities

**Documentation Status**: GENERIC PATTERNS
- References older generic `provision.yml` with provider parameters
- Doesn't reflect evolved, more specific command structure
- Missing unified cleanup documentation

**Required Updates**:
- Update command structure documentation
- Document specific provisioning playbooks
- Add unified cleanup procedures
