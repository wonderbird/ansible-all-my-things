## Tool Usage Patterns

### Windows Server Configuration (Implemented)
```yaml
# Windows inventory configuration ✅ WORKING
# inventories/aws/group_vars/windows/vars.yml
admin_user_on_fresh_system: "Administrator"
ansible_shell_type: powershell
ansible_shell_executable: powershell

# SSH connection working with PowerShell integration
# SSH key authentication via icacls permissions
# Administrator account with RDP access enabled
```

### Windows Package Management (Implemented)
```yaml
# Chocolatey installation pattern ✅ WORKING
- name: Install Chocolatey package manager
  win_shell: |
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
    [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072
    iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
  args:
    creates: C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\choco.exe
