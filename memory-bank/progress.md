## What's Left to Build

### AWS EC2 Integration ðŸš§ (In Progress)
**Status**: Planning phase, use case documented

**Required Components**:
- [ ] `provisioners/aws.yml` - AWS EC2 instance provisioning
- [ ] `inventories/aws/` - AWS dynamic inventory configuration
- [ ] `inventories/aws/group_vars/dev/vars.yml` - AWS-specific variables
- [ ] AWS credential setup documentation
- [ ] Testing and validation

**Key Decisions Needed**:
- AWS region selection (default vs. configurable)
- Security group configuration
- Key pair management strategy
- Instance naming conventions

### Enhanced Cost Management ðŸ“‹ (Planned)
- [ ] Cost estimation tools
- [ ] Resource tagging for cost tracking
- [ ] Automated cost alerts
- [ ] Usage reporting and optimization

### Additional Cloud Providers ðŸ“‹ (Future)
- [ ] Google Cloud Platform integration
- [ ] DigitalOcean integration
- [ ] Azure integration
- [ ] Provider comparison documentation

### Advanced Security Features ðŸ“‹ (Future)
- [ ] Advanced system hardening
- [ ] Security monitoring and logging
- [ ] Automated security updates
- [ ] Compliance reporting

## Current Status Summary

### Fully Functional âœ…
- **Hetzner Cloud**: Production-ready with complete lifecycle management
- **Local Testing**: Comprehensive testing across multiple virtualization platforms
- **Core Configuration**: All essential development tools and applications
- **Security**: Proper credential management and user isolation

### In Development ðŸš§
- **AWS Integration**: MVP development environment for secure testing
- **Documentation**: Memory bank initialization and maintenance

### Planned ðŸ“‹
- **Multi-Cloud**: Additional provider support
- **Enhanced Features**: Advanced security, monitoring, cost management
- **Automation**: CI/CD integration and scheduled operations

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Desktop on Docker**: Cannot run desktop environment in Docker containers
- **Provider-Specific Admin Users**: Different initial users across providers
- **Manual Credential Setup**: Initial vault and provider credential configuration
- **Single Region**: Currently limited to single region per provider

### Technical Debt
- **Error Handling**: Could be more comprehensive across all playbooks
- **Testing Coverage**: Need automated testing for all provider combinations
- **Documentation**: Some playbooks need better inline documentation
- **Performance**: Optimization opportunities in package installation

### Monitoring Gaps
- **Cost Tracking**: No automated cost monitoring across providers
- **Resource Usage**: Limited visibility into actual resource utilization
- **Performance Metrics**: No systematic performance measurement
- **Security Auditing**: Manual security review process

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design Decisions (Validated)
- **Ansible as Core Technology**: Proven effective for infrastructure automation
- **Multi-Provider Strategy**: Successfully abstracted provider differences
- **Three-Tier User Model**: Provides proper security and operational separation
- **Vault-Based Security**: Effective credential management without version control exposure

### Lessons Learned
- **Provider Abstraction Works**: Common playbooks successfully work across providers
- **Testing is Critical**: Local testing catches provider-specific issues early
- **Security by Default**: Upfront security design prevents later complications
- **Modular Design**: Individual playbooks enable flexible configuration

### Architectural Insights
- **Dynamic Inventory**: Essential for cloud provider integration
- **Symmetric Operations**: Backup/restore pairs ensure data preservation
- **Conditional Logic**: Provider-aware tasks handle differences gracefully
- **Early User Creation**: Immediate switch from admin user improves security

## Success Metrics Achieved

### Performance Targets âœ…
- **Hetzner Provisioning**: 10-15 minutes from start to configured desktop
- **Configuration Consistency**: Zero manual intervention required
- **Cost Control**: Complete resource cleanup eliminates ongoing costs
- **Security**: No secrets in version control, all credentials encrypted

### User Experience Goals âœ…
- **Simple Commands**: Single playbook execution for complete environments
- **Consistent Interface**: Identical commands across different providers
- **Reliable Operation**: Repeatable results across multiple deployments
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage instructions

## Next Milestone: AWS MVP

### Definition of Done
