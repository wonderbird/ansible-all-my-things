# Progress: Ansible All My Things

## Current Status

### Command Restriction System ðŸ”´ URGENT IMPLEMENTATION
**Status**: Command restriction system implementation in progress
**Goal**: Deploy command restrictions to target systems via ansible
**Timeline**: 2-3 days maximum for implementation
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - required for safe AI agent operation on target systems

## What Works

### Cross-Provider Infrastructure âœ… OPERATIONAL
- **Hetzner Cloud Linux**: `hobbiton` - Complete development environment (~$4/month)
- **AWS Linux**: `rivendell` - On-demand development server (~$8-10/month)
- **AWS Windows**: `moria` - Windows application server with Claude Desktop access (~$60/month on-demand)

### Core System Features âœ… OPERATIONAL
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete automation of environment lifecycle across providers
- **Security by Design**: Ansible Vault encryption, SSH key management working cross-provider
- **Unified Management**: Single automation framework managing diverse infrastructure
- **Cross-Provider Documentation**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **Target System Architecture**: AI agents operate on provisioned systems under desktop_users accounts

## What's Next

### Command Restriction System Implementation ðŸ”´ IN PROGRESS
- **Goal**: Deploy command restriction system to target systems preventing AI agents from executing infrastructure commands
- **Target Systems**: Deploy to `hobbiton`, `rivendell`, `moria` under `desktop_users` accounts (`galadriel`, `legolas`)
- **Implementation Approaches**: Three options under consideration:
  1. **User Profile Integration**: Deploy restriction scripts to desktop_users' profiles
  2. **System-Wide Wrappers**: Deploy global wrapper scripts via ansible
  3. **Service-Based Blocking**: Deploy monitoring services that block commands
- **Requirements**: Sub-shell resistant command blocking, cross-platform compatibility, ansible integration
- **Success Criteria**: Persistent blocking across Claude tool calls, remote verification capability, reboot persistence

## Technical Foundation

### Infrastructure Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
- **Multi-Provider**: Proven abstraction patterns across AWS and Hetzner Cloud
- **Cross-Platform**: Both Linux and Windows implementations working
- **Cost Optimization**: Provider choice optimized for specific usage patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing framework with proper variable management

### Current Implementation Status
- **Cross-Provider Infrastructure**: Three production-ready implementations successfully deployed âœ…
- **Enhanced Inventory System**: Advanced inventory structure with provider-specific targeting âœ…
- **Idiomatic Ansible Configuration**: Complete transition to best practices âœ…
- **Target System Deployment**: Ready for command restriction implementation âœ…

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Select Implementation Approach**: Choose from three command restriction approaches
2. **Develop Ansible Playbooks**: Create deployment automation for restrictions
3. **Test Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Verify functionality on Linux and Windows target systems
4. **Integrate with User Provisioning**: Extend existing `playbooks/setup-users.yml` workflow
5. **Implement Remote Verification**: Enable status checking from control machine via ansible

The project has achieved its primary infrastructure objectives and is ready for command restriction system deployment to target systems.
