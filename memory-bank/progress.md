# Progress: Ansible All My Things

## Current Status

### Command Restriction System üî¥ URGENT IMPLEMENTATION
**Status**: Command restriction system implementation in progress
**Goal**: Deploy command restrictions to target systems via ansible
**Timeline**: 2-3 days maximum for implementation
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - required for safe AI agent operation on target systems

## What Works

### Cross-Provider Infrastructure ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- **Hetzner Cloud Linux**: `hobbiton` - Complete development environment (~$4/month)
- **AWS Linux**: `rivendell` - On-demand development server (~$8-10/month)
- **AWS Windows**: `moria` - Windows application server with Claude Desktop access (~$60/month on-demand)

### Core System Features ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete automation of environment lifecycle across providers
- **Security by Design**: Ansible Vault encryption, SSH key management working cross-provider
- **Unified Management**: Single automation framework managing diverse infrastructure
- **Cross-Provider Documentation**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **Target System Architecture**: AI agents operate on provisioned systems under desktop_users accounts

## What's Next

### Command Restriction System Implementation üî¥ IN PROGRESS
- **Goal**: Deploy command restriction system to target systems preventing AI agents from executing infrastructure commands
- **Target Systems**: Deploy to `hobbiton`, `rivendell`, `moria` under `desktop_users` accounts (`galadriel`, `legolas`)
- **Implementation Approaches**: Six options evaluated:
  1. **User Profile Integration**: Deploy restriction scripts to desktop_users' profiles ‚úÖ VIABLE
  2. **System-Wide Wrappers**: Deploy global wrapper scripts via ansible ‚úÖ VIABLE
  3. **Service-Based Blocking**: Deploy monitoring services that block commands ‚úÖ VIABLE
  4. **fapolicyd Integration**: Red Hat's File Access Policy Daemon ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT RECOMMENDED (Linux-only)
  5. **AppArmor Integration**: Deploy AppArmor profiles for Ubuntu/Debian target systems ‚úÖ VIABLE
  6. **Claude CLI Native Restrictions**: Deploy `.claude/settings.json` via ansible ‚úÖ VIABLE
- **Requirements**: Sub-shell resistant command blocking, cross-platform compatibility, ansible integration
- **Success Criteria**: Persistent blocking across Claude tool calls, remote verification capability, reboot persistence

### Documentation Streamlining ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Memory Bank Restructured**: Removed discovery narrative and "broken state" language from all files
- **Implementation Approaches Consolidated**: From 8 scattered options to 6 clear approaches with 5 viable options
- **Forward-Looking Documentation**: Rewritten as if target system deployment was always the known approach
- **fapolicyd Research**: Comprehensive analysis completed, documented but assessed as unsuitable for cross-platform requirements
- **AppArmor Research**: Ubuntu/Debian equivalent identified with kernel-level security and user-specific targeting capabilities

## Technical Foundation

### Infrastructure Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Multi-Provider**: Proven abstraction patterns across AWS and Hetzner Cloud
- **Cross-Platform**: Both Linux and Windows implementations working
- **Cost Optimization**: Provider choice optimized for specific usage patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing framework with proper variable management

### Current Implementation Status
- **Cross-Provider Infrastructure**: Three production-ready implementations successfully deployed ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced Inventory System**: Advanced inventory structure with provider-specific targeting ‚úÖ
- **Idiomatic Ansible Configuration**: Complete transition to best practices ‚úÖ
- **Target System Deployment**: Ready for command restriction implementation ‚úÖ

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Select Implementation Approach**: Development team and software architect to analyze and choose from six documented approaches
2. **Develop Ansible Playbooks**: Create deployment automation for restrictions
3. **Test Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Verify functionality on Linux and Windows target systems
4. **Integrate with User Provisioning**: Extend existing `playbooks/setup-users.yml` workflow
5. **Implement Remote Verification**: Enable status checking from control machine via ansible

## Recent Accomplishments

- **Documentation Excellence**: Successfully streamlined entire memory bank and development increment documentation
- **Research Completeness**: Thoroughly evaluated enterprise-grade security solutions (fapolicyd, AppArmor) to ensure no viable approaches were overlooked
- **Ubuntu Solution Identified**: AppArmor provides robust kernel-level command blocking with native Ubuntu/Debian support
- **Clear Decision Path**: Six implementation approaches documented for development team and software architect analysis

The project has achieved its primary infrastructure objectives, completed comprehensive solution research, and is ready for command restriction system implementation on target systems.
