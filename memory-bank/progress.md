# Progress: Ansible All My Things

## Current Status

### Command Restriction System üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY GAP DISCOVERED
**Status**: Current system fundamentally broken with Claude Code - urgent security fix required
**Problem**: Shell session isolation causes restriction bypass, creating security and compliance risks
**Timeline**: 2-3 days maximum for robust solution implementation
**Priority**: **CRITICAL** - blocks safe AI agent operation in project

## What Works (Production Infrastructure)

### Cross-Provider Infrastructure ‚úÖ PRODUCTION-READY
- **Hetzner Cloud Linux**: `hobbiton` - Complete development environment (~$4/month)
- **AWS Linux**: `rivendell` - On-demand development server (~$8-10/month)
- **AWS Windows**: `moria` - Windows application server with Claude Desktop access (~$60/month on-demand)

### Core System Features ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete automation of environment lifecycle across providers
- **Security by Design**: Ansible Vault encryption, SSH key management working cross-provider
- **Unified Management**: Single automation framework managing diverse infrastructure
- **Cross-Provider Documentation**: Complete setup and usage instructions

## What's Next (Critical Priority)

### Robust Command Restriction System Implementation üî¥ URGENT & IN PROGRESS
- **Goal**: Implement bulletproof command restriction system preventing AI agents from executing infrastructure commands ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
- **Business Driver**: **SECURITY CRITICAL** - Current restriction mechanism fundamentally broken with Claude Code architecture ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT
- **Problem**: Claude Code's shell session isolation bypasses bash function-based restrictions ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCOVERED
- **Impact**: Security risk of accidental infrastructure provisioning, compliance violation, workflow disruption ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH RISK
- **Requirements**: Sub-shell resistant command blocking, comprehensive command coverage, AI agent verification system ‚ö†Ô∏è MVP SCOPE
- **Success Criteria**: Persistent blocking across Claude tool calls, reliable status verification, robust implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFINED
- **Implementation**: Solution approach selection required from wrapper scripts, environment detection, direnv, or shell initialization ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING

## Technical Foundation

### Infrastructure Architecture ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Multi-Provider**: Proven abstraction patterns across AWS and Hetzner Cloud
- **Cross-Platform**: Both Linux and Windows implementations working
- **Cost Optimization**: Provider choice optimized for specific usage patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing framework with proper variable management

### Current Implementation Status
- **Cross-Provider Infrastructure**: Three production-ready implementations successfully deployed ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced Inventory System**: Advanced inventory structure with provider-specific targeting ‚úÖ
- **Idiomatic Ansible Configuration**: Complete transition to best practices ‚úÖ
- **Command Restriction System**: **BROKEN** - requires immediate implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è

The project has successfully achieved its primary infrastructure objectives but discovered a critical security gap that requires immediate resolution to enable safe AI agent operation.
