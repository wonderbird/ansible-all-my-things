- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage instructions

## Current Focus: Windows Server MVP (URGENT)

### Primary Objective
**Goal**: Deliver minimal viable Windows Server with Claude Desktop access for immediate work needs.

**Timeline**: URGENT (2-3 days delivery)

**Business Driver**: User needs Claude Desktop access for current work projects - immediate delivery required.

**Foundation**: AWS Linux implementation provides proven patterns for Windows extension.

## Windows Server MVP Implementation Status

### Day 1: Windows Server Provisioning (In Progress)
- [ ] **Create Windows Provisioner**: Copy `provisioners/aws-ec2.yml` → `provisioners/aws-windows.yml`
- [ ] **Windows Server AMI**: Use Windows Server 2022 with Desktop Experience (latest AMI)
- [ ] **Instance Configuration**: t3.large (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) for reliability over cost
- [ ] **Security Group**: RDP (port 3389) access from user's IP address
- [ ] **Administrator Setup**: Simple password-based authentication

### Day 2: Windows Configuration & Claude Desktop
- [ ] **Install ansible.windows**: Add Windows Ansible collection support
- [ ] **Windows Inventory**: Extend AWS inventory to handle Windows instances
- [ ] **RDP Configuration**: Enable RDP and configure Windows Firewall
- [ ] **Claude Desktop**: Manual installation via PowerShell (automated later)
- [ ] **Basic User Setup**: Administrator account configuration

### Day 2-3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] **Playbook Integration**: Create `provision-aws-windows.yml` and `destroy-aws-windows.yml`
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**: Complete provision → RDP access → Claude Desktop → destroy cycle
- [ ] **Access Validation**: Verify Claude Desktop works for actual work tasks
- [ ] **Basic Documentation**: Quick usage guide for Windows Server access

## Dual-Track Approach

### Track 1: MVP (Urgent - Next 2-3 Days)
**Status**: In Progress
**Goal**: Working Windows Server with Claude Desktop access
**Quality**: "Good enough" - reliable but not optimized
**Cost**: ~$60/month acceptable initially

### Track 2: Long-term Optimization (After MVP)
**Status**: Planned for future
**Goal**: Cost-optimized, fully automated Windows Server solution
**Quality**: Production-ready with comprehensive automation
**Cost**: Target $15/month through optimization

## Technical Foundation Ready for Windows

### Reusable AWS Infrastructure ✅
- **AWS Credentials**: Environment variable-based authentication working
- **Dynamic Inventory**: `amazon.aws.aws_ec2` plugin supports both Linux and Windows
- **Security Groups**: Automated firewall rule management patterns established
- **Instance Management**: `amazon.aws.ec2_instance` module works for Windows AMIs
- **Resource Cleanup**: Complete destroy operations with proper cleanup

### Proven Automation Patterns ✅
- **Idempotent Provisioning**: Fixed instance identifiers prevent duplicates
- **Modular Configuration**: Separate playbooks for specific functionality
- **Credential Management**: Ansible Vault encryption for sensitive data
- **Provider Abstraction**: Clean separation between provisioning and configuration

## Windows Server Planning Details

### Target Configuration
- **OS**: Windows Server 2022 with Desktop Experience
- **Instance Type**: t3.medium (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM minimum for GUI)
- **Storage**: 50GB GP3 EBS (Windows Server space requirements)
- **Network**: RDP access from user's IP address only
- **Applications**: Claude Desktop Application + supporting software

### Cost Analysis
- **t3.medium**: ~$30/month (720 hours × $0.0416/hour)
- **Windows License**: Included in AWS Windows AMI pricing
- **Storage**: 50GB × $0.08/GB = $4/month
- **Total**: ~$34/month if running continuously
- **Target Usage**: 10-15 hours/week = ~$15/month actual cost

### Technical Requirements
- **Ansible Collections**: `ansible.windows`, `community.windows`
- **Connection Method**: WinRM for automation, RDP for desktop access
- **Package Management**: Chocolatey for automated software installation
- **User Management**: Windows Administrator model with service accounts

## Success Metrics for Windows Implementation

### Performance Targets
- **Provisioning Time**: ≤20 minutes (Windows startup + configuration)
- **Claude Desktop Ready**: Immediately accessible via RDP after provisioning
- **RDP Responsiveness**: Smooth desktop application interaction
- **Destroy Time**: ≤5 minutes for complete resource cleanup

### Cost Targets
- **Monthly Cost**: ≤$15 for typical usage patterns (10-15 hours/week)
- **Session Cost**: ~$0.50-0.75 per 2-3 hour usage session
- **No Ongoing Costs**: Complete resource cleanup when not in use

### User Experience Goals
- **Simple Commands**: Same playbook patterns as Linux implementation
- **Reliable Access**: Consistent RDP connectivity and performance
- **Application Ready**: Claude Desktop immediately available after provisioning
- **Clean Shutdown**: Complete environment destruction with single command

## Long-term Vision Progress

### Infrastructure as Code ✅
- Complete automation of Linux environment lifecycle
- Version-controlled infrastructure configuration
- Reproducible deployments across providers
- **Next**: Extend to Windows Server environments

### Cross-Platform Support (In Progress)
- **Linux**: Production-ready across multiple providers
- **Windows**: Foundation established, implementation in progress
- **Applications**: Claude Desktop as primary Windows use case
- **Future**: Additional Windows-only applications and development tools

### Cost Optimization ✅
- On-demand resource provisioning working for Linux
- Complete cleanup eliminates ongoing costs
- Efficient resource utilization patterns established
- **Next**: Validate Windows Server cost targets
