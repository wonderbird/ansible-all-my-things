# Project Brief: Ansible All My Things

## Project Overview
An Ansible-based infrastructure automation system for personal IT environment management, enabling cross-platform development environments with focus on Windows Server support for applications unavailable on Linux/macOS.

## Core Purpose ✅ ACHIEVED
Automate complete lifecycle of development environments across cloud providers, with emphasis on:
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Enable Windows-only applications from non-Windows host systems ✅ ACHIEVED
- **AWS Windows Server**: Primary target for Windows-specific applications ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **AWS Linux Foundation**: Proven foundation successfully extended to Windows Server ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Application Focus**: Framework ready for Claude Desktop and other Windows applications ✅ READY
- **Cost Efficiency**: On-demand provisioning with complete resource cleanup ✅ ACHIEVED

## Key Requirements

- **Platform**: AWS EC2 Windows Server instances (t3.large) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Access Method**: SSH and RDP for comprehensive environment access ✅ WORKING
- **Foundation**: Successfully extended existing AWS Linux implementation ✅ ACHIEVED
- **Timeline**: URGENT (2-3 days delivery) ✅ DELIVERED
- **Business Driver**: Immediate Windows application access needs ✅ MET
- **Cost**: ~$60/month with on-demand usage reducing actual costs ✅ ACCEPTABLE

#### Track 2: Future Optimization Opportunities
- **Goal**: Cost-optimized, fully automated Windows Server solution
- **Timeline**: Available for future implementation as needed
- **Target Cost**: $15/month achievable with t3.medium downgrade and usage optimization
- **Quality**: Production-ready with comprehensive automation
- **Features**: Advanced security, performance tuning, full automation

### Multi-Provider Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- **AWS EC2**: Production-ready Linux and Windows implementations ✅ BOTH WORKING
- **Hetzner Cloud**: Production-ready Linux environments ✅ WORKING
- **Local Testing**: Vagrant-based testing for Linux configurations ✅ WORKING

### Complete Lifecycle Management ✅ ACHIEVED
1. **Provision**: Create Windows Server infrastructure on AWS ✅ AUTOMATED
2. **Configure**: Automatic Chocolatey installation and RDP optimization ✅ AUTOMATED
3. **Access**: SSH and RDP-based environment access ✅ WORKING
4. **Destroy**: Unified teardown to eliminate costs ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Current Status ✅ PRODUCTION-READY
