# Product Context: Ansible All My Things

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
**Windows-Only Application Access**: Claude Desktop Application is only available on Windows and macOS, creating a gap for users on Linux systems or those who need isolated Windows environments for specific applications.

**Cross-Platform Development Needs**: Many applications and tools are platform-specific, requiring access to different operating systems for complete development workflows.

### The Solution Vision
A unified automation system that provides on-demand access to Windows Server environments via AWS EC2, enabling:
- **Application Access**: Run Windows-only applications like Claude Desktop from any host system
- **Cost Control**: Complete resource lifecycle management with automatic cleanup
- **Isolation**: Secure, dedicated environments for specific applications
- **Consistency**: Automated setup ensuring identical configurations

## How It Should Work

### Target User Experience
```bash
# Provision Windows Server with Claude Desktop
ansible-playbook provision-aws-windows.yml

# Access via RDP to use Claude Desktop Application
# (RDP connection details provided after provisioning)

# Destroy environment when done
ansible-playbook destroy-aws-windows.yml
```

### Primary Workflow: Claude Desktop Access
1. **Provision**: Windows Server 2022 instance with desktop environment (15-20 minutes)
2. **Configure**: Automatic Claude Desktop Application installation and setup
3. **Access**: RDP connection to Windows desktop environment
4. **Use**: Claude Desktop Application available for immediate use
5. **Destroy**: Complete environment cleanup to stop costs

## Problems This Solves

### For Individual Users
- **Application Access**: Use Windows-only applications without Windows hardware
- **Isolation**: Dedicated environment for specific applications without local installation
- **Cost Control**: Pay only when actively using Windows applications
- **Flexibility**: On-demand Windows environments without permanent infrastructure

### Technical Benefits
- **Foundation Reuse**: Leverages proven AWS Linux automation patterns
- **Scalability**: Easy extension to other Windows-only applications
- **Security**: Isolated environments for application testing and usage

## Success Indicators

### Quantitative Measures
- Windows Server provisioning time: â‰¤20 minutes
- Claude Desktop ready for use immediately after provisioning
- Cost under $15/month for typical usage patterns
- Zero manual configuration required

### Qualitative Measures
- Seamless access to Claude Desktop Application
- Consistent Windows environment across deployments
- Reliable RDP connectivity and performance
- Easy environment cleanup and cost control

## User Persona

### Primary: Developer/Professional needing Windows-only applications
- Needs access to Claude Desktop Application
- Works primarily on Linux/macOS systems
- Values cost-effective, on-demand access
- Requires reliable, automated setup

## Integration Philosophy
Windows Server support should feel like a natural extension of the existing Linux automation, using familiar Ansible patterns while handling Windows-specific requirements transparently.
