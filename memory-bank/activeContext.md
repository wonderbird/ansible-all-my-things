## Next Major Enhancement: Unified Inventory System

### Unified Inventory Design ðŸ”„ NEXT PRIORITY
**Goal**: Single-command visibility of all infrastructure across providers and platforms

**Target Structure:**
```
inventories/
â”œâ”€â”€ aws.yml                    # AWS dynamic inventory (rivendell, moria)
â”œâ”€â”€ hcloud.yml                 # Hetzner Cloud dynamic inventory (hobbiton)
â””â”€â”€ group_vars/
    â”œâ”€â”€ all/vars.yml           # Global variables (merged common vars)
    â”œâ”€â”€ linux/vars.yml         # Linux-specific variables (hobbiton + rivendell)
    â””â”€â”€ windows/vars.yml       # Windows-specific variables (moria)
```

**Expected Output:**
GIVEN hobbiton is a Linux instance hosted in the Hetzner Cloud
AND rivendell is a Linux instance hosted in the AWS EC2 cloud
AND moria is a Windows instance hosted in the AWS EC2 cloud
WHEN I execute the command `ansible-inventory --graph`
THEN I see the output
```
@all:
  |--@linux:
  |  |--hobbiton
  |  |--rivendell
  |--@windows:
  |  |--moria
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Single inventory directory with multiple provider files
- Platform-based grouping only (linux/windows)
- No provider-specific groups (aws/hcloud)
- Consolidated group_vars with merged common variables
- Maximally simplified design for unified instance visibility

**Implementation Readiness:**
- All three instances use compatible dynamic inventory patterns
- Platform-based grouping already implemented in each provider
- Group variables already organized by platform structure
- Cross-provider SSH key management proven to work
