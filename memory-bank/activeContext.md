# Active Context: Ansible All My Things

## Current Work Focus

### Unified Inventory System ✅ COMPLETED & TESTED
**Goal**: Restructure inventory to provide unified visibility of all running instances across providers with single `ansible-inventory --graph` command.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Implementation successful and user-tested

**Business Context**: Operational efficiency - single command visibility of all instances across AWS and Hetzner Cloud providers.

**Foundation**: Building on three production-ready implementations across providers and platforms.

**Target**: Single inventory command showing instances hobbiton, moria, and rivendell grouped by platform (linux/windows) only.

**Implementation**: Complete unified inventory system with provider-aware group_vars and updated playbooks.

**Key Technical Solutions**:
- **Dependency Management**: Created `requirements.txt` and `requirements.yml` for streamlined setup

## Unified Inventory System Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

### Unified Inventory System ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED
**Goal**: Single-command visibility of all infrastructure across providers and platforms

**Business Driver**: Cost control - reliable `ansible-inventory --graph` showing all instances across providers to eliminate manual console checking

**Implementation Status:**
- **Milestone 1**: Core Unified Inventory Structure with Playbook Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- **Milestone 2**: Acceptance Testing & Validation ✅ COMPLETED
- **Milestone 3**: Documentation Updates ✅ COMPLETED

**Implemented Structure:**
```
inventories/
├── aws_ec2.yml                # AWS dynamic inventory (rivendell, moria)
├── hcloud.yml                 # Hetzner Cloud dynamic inventory (hobbiton)
└── group_vars/
    ├── all/vars.yml           # Global variables (merged common vars)
    ├── linux/vars.yml         # Linux-specific variables (hobbiton + rivendell)
    ├── windows/vars.yml       # Windows-specific variables (moria)
    ├── aws/vars.yml           # AWS-specific overrides (ubuntu admin user)
    └── hcloud/vars.yml        # Hetzner-specific overrides (root admin user)
```

**Achieved Output:**
GIVEN hobbiton is a Linux instance hosted in the Hetzner Cloud
AND rivendell is a Linux instance hosted in the AWS EC2 cloud
AND moria is a Windows instance hosted in the AWS EC2 cloud
WHEN I execute the command `ansible-inventory --graph`
THEN I see the output ✅ VERIFIED
```
@all:
  |--@ungrouped:
  |--@aws_ec2:
  |  |--moria
  |  |--rivendell
  |--@windows:
  |  |--moria
  |--@linux:
  |  |--rivendell
  |  |--hobbiton
  |--@hcloud:
  |  |--hobbiton
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Single inventory directory with multiple provider files
- Platform-based grouping only (linux/windows)
- Provider-aware group_vars for handling admin user differences
- Variable precedence: all → platform → provider
- Direct migration approach with full playbook updates

**Implementation Readiness:**
- All three instances use compatible dynamic inventory patterns
- Platform-based grouping already implemented in each provider
- Provider-aware variable structure addresses admin user differences
- Cross-provider SSH key management proven to work
- **Scope Updated**: 2 playbooks require updates (provision.yml, provision-aws-windows.yml)

**Acceptance Test Plan:**
1. Provision instances on both providers (existing playbooks)
2. Verify instances appear in unified `ansible-inventory --graph`
3. Destroy instances (existing playbooks)
4. Verify AWS shows "terminated" state and Hetzner shows empty list
5. Verify unified inventory shows no instances

**Milestone 1 Tasks ✅ COMPLETED:**
1. Create unified inventory structure (aws_ec2.yml, hcloud.yml) ✅ COMPLETED
2. Implement provider-aware group_vars structure ✅ COMPLETED
3. Update ansible.cfg to point to ./inventories ✅ COMPLETED
4. Update 2 playbooks with hardcoded inventory paths ✅ COMPLETED
5. Test unified inventory functionality ✅ COMPLETED & VERIFIED
6. Remove legacy inventory structure ✅ COMPLETED

**Implementation Details:**
- **Unified Structure**: Created inventories/aws_ec2.yml and inventories/hcloud.yml
- **Provider-Aware Group Vars**: Implemented variable precedence (all → platform → provider)
- **Playbook Updates**: Updated provision.yml, provision-aws-windows.yml
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed inventories/aws/ and inventories/hcloud/ directories
- **Configuration**: Updated ansible.cfg to use unified ./inventories directory
- **Dependency Management**: Created requirements.txt and requirements.yml for streamlined setup
- **Technical Fixes**: Resolved boto3 dependency and AWS plugin recognition issues

**User Testing Commands:**
```bash
# 1. Set up environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-north-1"
echo -n "hcloud API token: "; read -s HCLOUD_TOKEN; export HCLOUD_TOKEN
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE="./ansible-vault-password.txt"
