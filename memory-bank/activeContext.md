# Active Context: Ansible All My Things

## Current Work Focus

### Robust Command Restriction System Implementation ðŸ”´ URGENT
**Goal**: Implement bulletproof command restriction system that prevents AI agents from executing infrastructure commands while working in the ansible-all-my-things project directory.

**Status**: ðŸ”´ IN PROGRESS - Critical security compliance issue requiring immediate resolution

**Business Context**: **SECURITY CRITICAL** - Current command restriction mechanism is fundamentally broken with Claude Code's architecture, creating security risks and compliance violations.

**Timeline**: **URGENT** - 2-3 days maximum delivery requirement

**Problem Discovered**: Claude Code creates independent shell sessions for each command execution, causing bash function-based restrictions to be lost across tool calls, making current `.clinerules/only-user-can-run-ansible-commands.md` ineffective.

**Business Impact**:
- **Security Risk**: Accidental execution of infrastructure commands could provision expensive resources or destroy existing infrastructure
- **Compliance Violation**: Project rules are technically unenforceable with current implementation
- **Workflow Disruption**: Unreliable restrictions force manual oversight and slow development

**MVP Requirements for Command Restriction System**:

**Core Problem**: AI agents create sub-bash shells for every command execution, bypassing current restriction mechanisms.

**MVP Deliverables**:
1. **Sub-Shell Resistant Command Blocking**: Mechanism that works when Claude creates new bash sub-shells
2. **Comprehensive Command Coverage**: Block all infrastructure commands (`ansible`, `ansible-playbook`, `ansible-vault`, `ansible-inventory`, `ansible-galaxy`, `ansible-config`, `vagrant`, `docker`, `tart`, `aws`, `hcloud`)
3. **AI Agent Verification System**: Enhanced `--status` command that works across sessions
4. **Easy Setup & Maintenance**: Extend existing `./scripts/setup-command-restrictions.sh` with project-scoped restrictions

**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… **Persistent Blocking**: Commands remain blocked across multiple separate Claude tool calls
- âœ… **Status Verification**: `--status` correctly shows "BLOCKED" status across sessions
- âœ… **Error Messages**: Blocked commands display project-rule-compliant error messages
- âœ… **Project Scope**: Restrictions only apply within ansible-all-my-things directory
- âœ… **User Override**: User can still execute commands when needed (restrictions only apply to Claude)

**Implementation Options Under Consideration**:
- **Approach A**: Wrapper Scripts (project-local PATH manipulation)
- **Approach B**: Environment Detection (persistent markers/files)
- **Approach C**: direnv Integration (automatic directory-based loading)
- **Approach D**: Shell Initialization (BASH_ENV/project-local .bashrc)

### Recently Completed: Idiomatic Ansible Configuration âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Apply idiomatic Ansible practices for secrets and variable management.

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - Transitioned from explicit vars file loading to proper inventory group_vars structure

**Business Context**: Technical debt elimination - modernizing variable and secret handling to follow Ansible best practices for maintainable infrastructure automation.

**Foundation**: Built on existing enhanced inventory system with proper secret management integration.

**Target**: Complete transition from `playbooks/vars-secrets.yml` to `inventories/group_vars/all/vars.yml` with automated vault password file handling.

**Implementation**: Successfully refactored all playbooks to use idiomatic Ansible variable loading patterns.

**Key Technical Solutions**:
- **Idiomatic Secret Management**: Transitioned from `playbooks/vars-secrets.yml` to `inventories/group_vars/all/vars.yml` âœ… COMPLETED
- **Automated Vault Password**: Updated `ansible.cfg` with `vault_password_file = ansible-vault-password.txt` âœ… COMPLETED
- **Playbook Refactoring**: Removed explicit vars file loading from all playbooks âœ… COMPLETED
- **Testing Integration**: Fixed Vagrant test configurations for new secret handling âœ… COMPLETED

inventories/
â”œâ”€â”€ aws_ec2.yml                  # AWS dynamic inventory (rivendell, moria)
â”œâ”€â”€ hcloud.yml                   # Hetzner Cloud dynamic inventory (hobbiton)
â””â”€â”€ group_vars/
    â”œâ”€â”€ all/vars.yml             # Global variables (merged common vars)
    â”œâ”€â”€ linux/vars.yml           # Linux-specific variables (hobbiton + rivendell)
    â”œâ”€â”€ windows/vars.yml         # Windows-specific variables (moria)
    â”œâ”€â”€ aws_ec2/vars.yml         # AWS-specific overrides (ubuntu admin user)

```

**Achieved Output:**
```
@all:
  |--@aws_ec2:
  |  |--moria
  |  |--rivendell
  |--@aws_ec2_linux:
  |  |--rivendell
  |--@aws_ec2_windows:
  |  |--moria
  |--@hcloud:
  |  |--hobbiton
  |--@hcloud_linux:
  |  |--hobbiton
  |--@linux:
  |  |--hobbiton
  |  |--rivendell
  |--@windows:
  |  |--moria
```
The test file test/test_unified_inventory.md shows the complete test specification.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Single inventory directory with multiple provider files
- Dual grouping strategy: cross-provider platforms (@linux, @windows) and provider-specific (@aws_ec2_linux, @hcloud_linux)
- Improved tag semantics: `platform: "linux"` instead of `ansible_group: "linux"`
- Provider-aware group_vars with enhanced granularity
- Variable precedence: all â†’ platform â†’ provider â†’ provider_platform
- Backward-compatible improvement maintaining existing playbook functionality

**Implementation Readiness:**
- All three instances use compatible dynamic inventory patterns
- Platform-based grouping already implemented in each provider
- Provider-aware variable structure addresses admin user differences
- Cross-provider SSH key management proven to work
- **Scope Updated**: 2 playbooks require updates (provision.yml, provision-aws-windows.yml)

**Acceptance Test Plan:**
1. Provision instances on both providers (existing playbooks)
2. Verify instances appear in unified `ansible-inventory --graph`
3. Destroy instances (existing playbooks)
4. Verify AWS shows "terminated" state and Hetzner shows empty list
5. Verify unified inventory shows no instances

**Enhanced Inventory Tasks âœ… COMPLETED:**

2. Implement provider-aware group_vars structure âœ… COMPLETED & ENHANCED
3. Update ansible.cfg to point to ./inventories âœ… COMPLETED
4. Update 2 playbooks with hardcoded inventory paths âœ… COMPLETED
5. Test unified inventory functionality âœ… COMPLETED & VERIFIED
6. Remove legacy inventory structure âœ… COMPLETED
7. Improve inventory group structure with dual keyed_groups âœ… COMPLETED
8. Update provisioner tags from ansible_group to platform âœ… COMPLETED
9. Reorganize group_vars for enhanced provider-specific targeting âœ… COMPLETED

**Implementation Details:**
- **Enhanced Inventory Structure**: Dual keyed_groups in aws_ec2.yml and hcloud.yml for cross-provider + provider-specific groups
- **Improved Tag Semantics**: Changed from `ansible_group` to `platform` tags for clearer intent
- **Enhanced Group Vars**: Implemented four-tier variable precedence (all â†’ platform â†’ provider â†’ provider_platform)
- **Group Vars Reorganization**: Renamed aws/* to aws_ec2/* directories and added provider-platform specific directories
- **Provisioner Updates**: Updated all provisioners to use new platform tags
- **Playbook Updates**: Updated provision.yml, provision-aws-windows.yml
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed inventories/aws/ and inventories/hcloud/ directories
- **Configuration**: Updated ansible.cfg to use unified ./inventories directory
- **Dependency Management**: Created requirements.txt and requirements.yml for streamlined setup
- **Technical Fixes**: Resolved boto3 dependency and AWS plugin recognition issues
