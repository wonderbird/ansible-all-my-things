## Next Major Enhancement: Unified Inventory System

### Unified Inventory Design ðŸ”„ NEXT PRIORITY
**Target Structure:**
```
inventories/
â”œâ”€â”€ aws.yml                    # AWS dynamic inventory
â”œâ”€â”€ hcloud.yml                 # Hetzner Cloud dynamic inventory  
â””â”€â”€ group_vars/
    â”œâ”€â”€ all/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vars.yml           # Global variables (merged common vars)
    â”œâ”€â”€ linux/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vars.yml           # Linux-specific variables (merged)
    â””â”€â”€ windows/
        â””â”€â”€ vars.yml           # Windows-specific variables (merged)
```

**Expected Output:**
GIVEN hobbiton is a Linux instance hosted in the Hetzner Cloud
AND rivendell is a Linux instance hosted in the AWS EC2 cloud
AND moria is a Windows instance hosted in the AWS EC2 cloud
WHEN I execute the command `ansible-inventory --graph`
THEN I see the output
```
@all:
  |--@linux:
  |  |--hobbiton
  |  |--rivendell
  |--@windows:
  |  |--moria
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Single inventory directory with multiple provider files
- Platform-based grouping only (linux/windows)
- No provider-specific groups (aws/hcloud)
- Consolidated group_vars with merged common variables
- Maximally simplified design for unified instance visibility
