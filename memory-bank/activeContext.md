# Active Context: Ansible All My Things

## Current Work Focus

### Command Restriction System Implementation üî¥ URGENT
**Goal**: Deploy command restriction system to target systems that prevents AI agents from executing infrastructure commands.

**Status**: üî¥ IN PROGRESS - Critical implementation priority

**Business Context**: Infrastructure automation projects require AI agent safety controls to prevent accidental resource provisioning or destruction on target systems.

**Target System Deployment**: AI agents operate on target systems (`hobbiton`, `rivendell`, `moria`) under `desktop_users` accounts (`galadriel`, `legolas`), requiring ansible-deployed command restrictions.

**Timeline**: **URGENT** - 2-3 days maximum delivery requirement

**Core Challenge**: Deploy restrictions via ansible that work reliably across Claude Code's independent shell sessions on target systems.

**Business Impact**:
- **Security Risk**: Prevent accidental execution of infrastructure commands on target systems
- **Compliance Requirement**: Enforce project rules via ansible deployment
- **Workflow Protection**: Enable safe AI agent operation during development

**MVP Deliverables**:
1. **Sub-Shell Resistant Command Blocking**: Mechanism that works across Claude's bash sessions on target systems
2. **Comprehensive Command Coverage**: Block infrastructure commands (`ansible`, `vagrant`, `docker`, `aws`, `hcloud`) on target systems
3. **Ansible-Integrated Deployment**: Deploy restrictions via ansible playbooks to `desktop_users` on target systems
4. **Cross-Platform Support**: Work on AWS Linux, AWS Windows, and Hetzner Cloud target systems
5. **Remote Verification System**: Verify restriction status on target systems from control machine via ansible

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ **Persistent Blocking**: Commands remain blocked across multiple Claude tool calls on target systems
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Works on AWS Linux, AWS Windows, and Hetzner Cloud systems
- ‚úÖ **Ansible Integration**: Deployed automatically during infrastructure provisioning
- ‚úÖ **Target User Coverage**: Applied to all `desktop_users` (galadriel, legolas) on target systems
- ‚úÖ **Reboot Persistence**: Restrictions survive system reboots and updates
- ‚úÖ **Remote Verification**: Status checkable from control machine via ansible

**Implementation Approaches**:
- **User Profile Integration**: Deploy restriction scripts to desktop_users' profiles on target systems
- **System-Wide Wrappers**: Deploy global wrapper scripts to target systems via ansible
- **Service-Based Blocking**: Deploy services that monitor and block commands on target systems
- **fapolicyd Integration**: Red Hat's File Access Policy Daemon (Linux-only, not recommended for this use case)
- **Claude CLI Native Restrictions**: Deploy `.claude/settings.json` via ansible (‚≠ê RECOMMENDED - native architecture integration)

## Current System State

### Infrastructure Status
Production-ready cross-provider infrastructure automation:
- **Hetzner Cloud Linux**: `hobbiton` - Complete development environment
- **AWS Linux**: `rivendell` - On-demand development server  
- **AWS Windows**: `moria` - Windows application server with Claude Desktop access

### Technical Foundation
- Unified inventory system with proper group_vars structure
- Idiomatic Ansible configuration with automated vault password handling
- Cross-provider SSH key management and credential patterns
- Target systems ready for command restriction deployment
- **Documentation streamlined**: Removed discovery narrative, consolidated approaches

## Recent Changes

### Documentation Streamlining Completed
- **Memory bank restructured**: Removed "broken state" and "discovery" language throughout all files
- **Implementation approaches consolidated**: From 8 scattered options to 4 clear distributed approaches
- **Forward-looking documentation**: Written as if target system deployment was always the known approach
- **fapolicyd research completed**: Documented as fourth approach but assessed as not suitable for cross-platform requirements

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Enhanced inventory system with provider-specific targeting
- Complete transition to idiomatic ansible configuration
- Unified command patterns across multiple cloud providers

### Next Steps
- Select command restriction implementation approach from the three viable options
- Develop ansible playbooks for restriction deployment
- Test cross-platform compatibility on target systems
- Integrate with existing user provisioning workflows
