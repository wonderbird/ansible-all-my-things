# Specification Quality Checklist: Flutter Ansible Role

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain and require resolution before
  `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`:
  - FR-011: Flutter installation method (apt, sdkmanager, archive download,
    or combination). This is the highest-priority clarification as it
    determines the entire implementation approach and affects idempotency
    strategy.
  - Edge case / FR (implicit): Whether the role should upgrade an existing
    Flutter installation or leave it untouched. This affects idempotency
    guarantees and re-run behaviour.
