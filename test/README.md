# Tests

## Manual Tests

At the moment, automatic tests are missing üòî.

The reason is that this project has been in a "proof of concept phase" until 2025-07-11.

Now the project is transitioning from a "Genesis" stage to a more mature "Custom Built" stage [wardley2020], [harrer2023]. Thus, existing manual tests are documented in this directory. Automated tests are planned.

## Test systems

The test systems use Vagrant.

- [docker](docker/README.md): Vagrant with Docker Provider
- [tart](tart/README.md): Vagrant with Tart Provider

## Warning: Refresh SSH Keys after cloning this repository

The SSH keys in [./docker/ssh_host_keys/](./docker/ssh_host_keys/) and [./ssh_user_key/](./ssh_user_key/) are published on GitHub. Thus, they are known to the entire world! If you use these keys, you risk being hacked.

Please generate fresh keys before building the Dockerfile in this directory:

```shell
cd ./test

# create new host keys before building the docker container(s)
ssh-keygen -q -N "" -t rsa -b 4096 -f ./docker/ssh_host_keys/ssh_host_rsa_key -C root@testlab
ssh-keygen -q -N "" -t ecdsa -f ./docker/ssh_host_keys/ssh_host_ecdsa_key -C root@testlab
ssh-keygen -q -N "" -t ed25519 -f ./docker/ssh_host_keys/ssh_host_ed25519_key -C root@testlab

# create a new key for the "vagrant" user
ssh-keygen -q -N "" -t ecdsa -b 521 -f ./ssh_user_key/id_ecdsa -C vagrant@testlab
```

### A note on incompatibility

The `Vagrantfile`s in each folder skip incompatible playbooks by tags.

Linux homebrew does not support the arm64 (Apple Silicon) architecture.
The tag `not-supported-on-vagrant-arm64` is intended for playbooks incompatible
with this architecture.

The Docker Ubuntu image does not support the XFCE desktop environment.
Because the playbook works for the Tart provider, it is tagged with
`not-supported-on-vagrant-docker`.

## Using the Vagrant VMs

The individual files [tart/README.md](./tart/README.md) and [docker/README.md](./docker/README.mde) describe how to provision the corresponding VM.

The section **Verify the Setup** in [/docs/create-vm.md](../docs/create-vm.md) describes how to use the VMs.

## Stopping or Destroying a Vagrant VM

To pause using a VM, enter

```shell
vagrant halt
```

To delete a VM completely, consider backing it up first, then enter

```shell
vagrant destroy -f
```
